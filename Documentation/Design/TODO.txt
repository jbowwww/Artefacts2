Most things work but queries involving comparison of long integer types cannot seem to get them working.
Says something like "greater than not defined fr types int64 and string"
I think it is Serialize.Linq that is unable to properly handle long integer types
Based on that, and that I do not like the way the serialized queries look as part of the GET URI,
replace Serialize.Linq with another drop in library or code something adequate.

	- May/may not prove useful to recall that Expression.ToString() was almost sufficient
	  It only failed to support generic types

ArtefactTestClient test methods RecurseDirectory() GetLargeFilesWithDupeSize() seem to work
	- Numeric values serializing over SS (and therefore into Mongo) as strings
		- Must be due to JsConfig.TryParseNumericTypes or JsCOnfig.TryParsePrimitiveTypes
	- All values should be persisted in Mongo as an expected appropriate type (e.g. numerics, dates, enums)
		- Probably better suited to server-side queries (don't have to do a lot of expression conversions / visitors)
		- How best to serialize/determine data types to server? If artefact.Data on server-side has desired types
		  for data members they will mostly persist into Mongo the same way
