Most things work but queries involving comparison of long integer types cannot seem to get them working.
Says something like "greater than not defined fr types int64 and string"
I think it is Serialize.Linq that is unable to properly handle long integer types
Based on that, and that I do not like the way the serialized queries look as part of the GET URI,
replace Serialize.Linq with another drop in library or code something adequate.

	- May/may not prove useful to recall that Expression.ToString() was almost sufficient
	  It only failed to support generic types
